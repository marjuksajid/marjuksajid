### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student of Software Development.
That implies, I learn the basics of many programming languages and different introductory courses on Software Development.
I am in love with edX and Coursera!
The courses and course-works are just awesome!
There are also a lot of websites for making millions of Software Developers!
